CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES::

TOP PRIORITY:
deletion of blocks causes MAJOR lag that becomes much worse with mroe particles as it has to check through every single particle in the particle list multiple times each time a delete call is used
full rebuild of particlelist system needed

MAJOR:
game slows down as more particles are emulated on screen

MINOR:
sand like particles will be blocked from falling by water like particles that happen to be falling near them



PARTICLE IDEAS::
lava - water liek particle that damages other particles and potentially sets others on fire, will turn into stone when it coosl down
stone - sand like particle, will turn into lava at high temperatures

gas like particles - this has already semi started with the steam particle, want to add multiple other gasses at later stages that have different bouyancy and different reactions to different particles
explosive particles - stuff liek c4, gunpower etc. will blow up causing fire and potentially damaging other blocks around it
living particles - semi started with plant particles. other stuff liek bugs, seeds, wood, leaf particles etc
