CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES::

TOP PRIORITY:
modification of system to use multithreading to work on multiple particles in tandem
change of particlelsit to use a chunk system instead to help threads to work easier

deletion of blocks causes MAJOR lag that becomes much worse with mroe particles as it has to check through every single particle in the particle list multiple times each time a delete call is used
full rebuild of particlelist system needed

MAJOR:
change from using SDL_RenderDrawPoint to SDL_RenderDrawPoints, will need to store an array of SDL_Point* to do so, should speed up drawing of particles however
game slows down as more particles are emulated on screen

MINOR:
sand like particles will be blocked from falling by water like particles that happen to be falling near them



PARTICLE IDEAS::
lava - water liek particle that damages other particles and potentially sets others on fire, will turn into stone when it coosl down
stone - sand like particle, will turn into lava at high temperatures

gas like particles - this has already semi started with the steam particle, want to add multiple other gasses at later stages that have different bouyancy and different reactions to different particles
explosive particles - stuff liek c4, gunpower etc. will blow up causing fire and potentially damaging other blocks around it
living particles - semi started with plant particles. other stuff liek bugs, seeds, wood, leaf particles etc
