CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES::

TOP PRIORITY:
modification of system to use multithreading to work on multiple particles in tandem
change of particlelsit to use a chunk system instead to help threads to work easier

MAJOR:


MINOR:
sand like particles will be blocked from falling by airborn like particles that happen to be ascending near them


PARTICLE IDEAS::
explosive particles - stuff liek c4, gunpower etc. will blow up causing fire and potentially damaging other blocks around it
living particles - semi started with plant particles. other stuff liek bugs, seeds, wood, leaf particles etc

NOTES::
speed test done on the full allParticles array being made out of both a 2d Vector and an straight 2d array
straight 2d array seems to have the advantage in perfmormace by about 10%, my expectations being lack of overhead causes this
