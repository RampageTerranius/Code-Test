CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES::

TOP PRIORITY:
modification of system to use multithreading to work on multiple particles in tandem, this will mean the simulation losing some accuracy, but should be worth it for the fps increase
look towards potentially switching to a quadtree layout for particles.

MAJOR:
change from using SDL_RenderDrawPoint to SDL_RenderDrawPoints, will need to store an array of SDL_Point* to do so, should speed up drawing of particles
game slows down as more particles are emulated on screen, check into ways to reduce fps loss
add flag for if particle is unable to move, other moving particles will need to activate near by particles flags on movement.


MINOR:
sand like particles will be blocked from falling by airborn like particles that happen to be falling near them

PARTICLE IDEAS:
explosive particles - stuff like c4, gunpower etc. will blow up causing fire and potentially damaging other blocks around it
living particles - semi started with plant particles. other stuff like bugs, seeds, wood, leaf particles etc
