CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES::

TOP PRIORITY:
modification of system to use multithreading to work on multiple particles in tandem
change of particlelsit to use a chunk system instead to help threads to work easier

MAJOR:
change from using SDL_RenderDrawPoint to SDL_RenderDrawPoints, will need to store an array of SDL_Point* to do so, should speed up drawing of particles however
game slows down as more particles are emulated on screen

MINOR:
sand like particles will be blocked from falling by water like particles that happen to be falling near them



PARTICLE IDEAS::
explosive particles - stuff liek c4, gunpower etc. will blow up causing fire and potentially damaging other blocks around it
living particles - semi started with plant particles. other stuff liek bugs, seeds, wood, leaf particles etc
